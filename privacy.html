            <h3>Children</h3>
            <p>This subsection pertains exclusively to 10fold platform". The Platform does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, you must have the permission of your parents or legal guardians to use the Platform, so please do not use the platform on your own and/or submit any Personal Data through the Platform. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Data on the Platform without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Data to 10fold platform, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@10fold.in" target="_blank">hello@10fold.in</a>, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases as expeditiously as possible.</p>

            <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
            <p>When you interact with us through the Platform, we may collect personal data and other information from you ("Personal Data") as further described below:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Personal Data That Users Provide Through the Platform:</strong>
            We collect Personal Data from you (including, but not limited to, your name, email address, your professiosn, bank details and credit / debit card information) when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you contact us with inquiries, request a subscription, or make a payment as a User. Wherever 10fold collects Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>We collect this Personal Data for the purposes of providing the Platform’s services to you, as well as providing customer service, conducting research and improving the Platform. For more details on why we collect your Personal Data and how we use it, please see the section below entitled "Our use of Personal Data and other information." While you are under no obligation to provide any Personal Data, should you choose to withhold such information, we may not be able to provide you with some or all of the Platform’s services.</p>

            <p><strong>By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data to the Services, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of the Company, and the authorized third parties.</strong></p>

            <strong>Other Information</strong>
            <p><strong>Metadata that Authorized Users Provide Through the Platform: </strong>
            Authorized Users own all right, title and interest to the data they provide or otherwise make available to the company, and we do not own, control, or license such data, except to the extent that we can leverage metadata to improve the experience of Authorized Users and Users on 10fold. The company may be required to share any personally identifiable information volunteered by Authorized Users with other third parties such as our payment gateway providers or video conferencing tools.</p>

            <p><strong>Non-Personal Data: </strong>
            When you interact with 10fold through the Platform, we automatically receive and store certain non-identifiable personal information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. Examples of this non-identifiable personal information include the type of internet browser or mobile device you use, any website from which you have come to the Platform, your operating system, location data ("Non-Personal Data"). 10fold may store such Non-Personal Data itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by the Company affiliates, agents or service providers. The Platform may use such Non-Personal Data to assist us in providing effective services and to collect broad demographic information for aggregate use.</p>

            <p><strong>Aggregated Data: </strong>
            In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Platform, 10fold often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data, Non-Personal Data, and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on a de-identified, aggregate basis, and 10fold may share this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents, and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. 10fold may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p>

            <p><strong>Location Information:</strong>
            When you use the Platform, the Platform may request that you provide your city or town and state or province of residence.</p>

            <p><strong>Third-Party Personal Data:</strong>
            10fold may also collect Users’ Personal Data relating to third parties stored in your email and mobile device address books, including, without limitation, names, email addresses, and phone numbers (collectively, "Third-Party Personal Data"). The Services may request your permission to access such Third-Party Personal Data.</p>

            <h3>Our Use of Personal Data and Other Information</h3>
            <p>10fold uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data about yourself, or have provided (or otherwise permitted the Platform to access) any Third-Party Personal Data in order to obtain access to or make use of particular features of the Platform, we will use your Personal Data and any such Third-Party Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services</p>

            <p>10fold may also use your Personal Data and other Non-Personal Data collected through the Platform to help us in providing the services offered by the Platform, processing transactions, fulfilling requests for information, receiving and sending communications, updating marketing lists, analyzing data, providing support services, or other tasks from time to time.</p>

            <p>10fold may, with your consent, use your Personal Data to contact you in the future to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you where permitted by applicable law. If we do so, each marketing communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "opt-out" of receiving future marketing communications. In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future marketing communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below.</p>

            <p>We may also use your Personal Data and Third-Party Personal Data to send communications relating to the Platform, in accordance with applicable laws. For example, we may send periodic emails to registered Users of the Platform relating to their recent interactions with the Platform, such as purchasing a subscription to 10fold or enabling Authorized Users. Also, if you use any feature of the Platform permitting you to communicate with third parties (such as to refer a third party to the Platform or to communicate with them regarding a subscription), either by submitting Third-Party Personal Data to the Platform or otherwise permitting the Platform to automatically access Third-Party Personal Data in your possession, you acknowledge and agree that you have the authority of the relevant third party for us to access and use the relevant Third-Party Personal Data and that you have notified these third parties and informed them how their information is collected and used by 10fold to provide the Platform’s services. We reserve the right to identify you as the person who has made the referral in any messages that are sent to them. We may use Third-Party Personal Data to (1) contact such third party using the Third-Party Personal Data provided, and/or (2) provide you with an editable template message designed to facilitate communication between you and such third party through the Platform. In addition to sending the foregoing communications, we may also send reminders or related messages to you and to third parties on your behalf from time to time where permitted by applicable law. In each case, any such communications sent to third parties using Third-Party Personal Data will provide a means to "opt-out" of receiving further communication of the same nature.</p>

            <p>If 10fold intends on using any Personal Data in any manner or for any purpose that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, we will obtain your prior informed consent as required by applicable law. Notably, Zoom customer data is not retained except for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. Similarly, Google OAuth customer data is not retained except for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. Google OAuth is a registration and authentication service provided by Google LLC. By registering or authenticating, Users allow 10fold to identify them and give them access to dedicated services. Personal Data processed include various types of Data in this Privacy Policy.</p>
            
            <h3>Our Disclosure of Personal Data and Other Information</h3>
            <p>10fold does not sell your information. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Business Transfers:</strong>
            As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.</p>

            <p><strong>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties:</strong>
            10fold like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include facilitating monetary transactions and maintaining databases. When we employ another entity to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function and require them to only use the information for the purposes for which it was collected.</p>

            <p><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong>
            10fold may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of 10fold, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of Users through the Platform, or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.</p>

            <h3>Cookies</h3>
            <p>When you interact with the Platform, we try to make that experience simple and meaningful. When you visit our Platform, our web server sends a cookie to your computer.

            <p>Some of the cookies used by the Platform are set by us, and some are set by third parties who are delivering services on our behalf.</p>

            <p>Most web and mobile device browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent that or to notify you each time a cookie is set.

            <p>Some information on the types of cookies we use and how we use them is set out below:</p>

                <li><strong>Functional Cookies: </strong>These cookies customize elements of the promotional layout and/or content of the pages of the Platform and remember that you have visited us before; this means we can identify the number of unique visitors we receive.

                <li><strong>Advertising and Targeting: </strong>These cookies collect information about the pages you visit online. They gather information about the pages that you visit or the functions of the Platform you use, and also other information about other websites that you visit, so as to place you in a "market segment". This information is only collected by reference to the IP address or unique device identifier that you are using (the applicable cookie identifier) and also can include information about the county or province and city or town you are in, together with the name of your internet service provider.
