            <div class="solid-line"></div>

            <h3>1. Scope</h3>
            <p>These Terms apply to your acquisition of <a href="https://10fold.in/" target="_blank">10fold.in</a> and <a href="https://app.10fold.in/" target="_blank">10fold web app</a> (collectively referred as "10fold"), future subscriptions, and any user-level interactions that relate to such purchases online. Some key terms are used throughout these Terms and are defined here. A "User" is someone acquiring a subscription or using the product under a free trial. An "Authorized User" is someone that has booked any type of session through the User's subdomain.</p>

            <h3>1.1 A Special Note about Children</h3>
            <p>For those who are considering acquiring an 10fold account: please note that 10fold collects personal information from its users—including Users and Authorized Users. Please review 10fold's <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> before purchasing. For the avoidance of doubt, these terms do apply to instructors purchasing a subscription for 10fold for use by students.</p>

            <h3>2. Account Registration</h3>
            <p>Users are required to provide accurate and complete registration information during on-boarding; please keep this information up-to-date. Users are responsible for all actions taken through their Accounts. Users also agree that all information provided to register or otherwise, including but not limited to through the use of any interactive features on 10fold, is governed by our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, and you consent to all actions that we take with respect to your information consistent with our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

            <h3>3. Changes to the Terms of Service</h3>
            <p>We may revise and update these Terms of Service from time to time in our sole discretion. All changes are effective immediately when we post them, and apply to all access and use thereafter. Governing Law will not apply to any disputes for which the parties have actual notice before the date the change is posted online. Additionally, no data security and use procedures related to any personal information and/or educational records collected through 10fold shall be modified through these Terms of Service; rather, proper notice of such modifications will be given to Users. </p>

            <p>Your continued use of the 10fold following the posting of revised Terms of Service means that you accept and agree to any changes. You are also expected to check this page from time to time to ensure you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you.</p>

            <h3>4. Changes to the Platform</h3>
            <p>We reserve the right to withdraw or amend 10fold in our sole discretion without notice. We will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of 10fold is unavailable at any time or for any period. From time to time, we may restrict access to some parts of 10fold, or the entire platform, to users, including registered Users.</p>

            <p>You are responsible for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Making all arrangements necessary for you to have access to the platform.</li>
                <li>Ensuring that all persons who access the platform through your internet connection are aware of these Terms of Service and comply with them.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you choose, or are provided with, a username, password, OTP, or any other piece of information as part of our security procedures, you must treat such information as confidential, and you must not disclose it to any other person or entity. You also acknowledge that your Account is personal to you and agree not to provide any other person with access to 10fold or portions of it your username, password, OTP, or any other security information. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized access to or use of your user name or password or OTP or any other breach of security. You also agree to ensure that you exit from your Account at the end of each session. You should use particular caution when accessing your Account from a public or shared computer so that others are not able to view or record your password or OTP or other personal information.</p>

            <p>We have the right to disable any username, password, OTP or other identifier, whether chosen by you or provided by us, at any time in our sole discretion for any or no reason, including if, in our opinion, you have violated any provision of these Terms of Service.</p>
